// # About this guide
//
// This guide teaches the basics of manipulating data using JavaScript in the
// browser, or in node.js. Specifically, these tasks are geared around preparing
// data for further analysis and visualization.
//
// This guide will demonstrate some basic techniques and how to implement them
// using core JavaScript API, the [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) library and [lodash](http://lodash.com/).
//
// It assumes you already have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.

// ## Tasks
//
// - ### [Getting Started](getting_started.html)
// - ### [Reading in Data](read_data.html)
// - ### [Summarizing Data](summarize_data.html)
// - ### [Iterating and Reducing](iterate_data.html)
// - ### [Nesting and Grouping Data](group_data.html)
//
// - ### [Strings](strings.html)
// - ### [Regular Expressions](regexes.html)
// - ### [Working with Time](time.html)
// - ### [Checking Data Assumptions](assumptions.html)
//
// ### Code
//
// Each document in this repo is executed when loaded into a browser. Check it out by opening the Developer Tools Console. You should see the output of the following code block:

console.log("This is the index!");

// Check out the [full source on github](https://github.com/vlandham/js_data).
//
// ### Why?
//
// Is data munging in JavaScript something you would actually want to do? _Maybe_.
//
// There are other languages out there that do a great job with data wrangling:
//
// - [R with dplyr](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/explore/README.html)
// - [python with pandas](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/fonnesbeck/5850413)
// - [java (just kidding)]()
//
// These tools are great and you should use them. Often times, however, you are already familiar with a particular language (like JavaScript) and would like to get started with data, but want to take it one step at a time.
//
// Additionally, sometimes you are already in a particular environment (like JavaScript) and don't have the luxury of switching to one of these other options.
//
// In these cases, JavaScript could be considered a viable option for your data analysis. And if you find yourself in one of these situations, or just want to try out JavaScript for data analysis for fun, then _this guide is for you_!
//
// Check out some of the tasks, and see if JavaScript Data something you want to try yourself.
