<h2 id="about-tasks">About Tasks</h2>
<p>Each task tries to encapsulate a concrete lesson around common data manipulation and analysis processes. </p>
<p>Focus is on client side data processing, but could easily be used in a server side (Node) application with a bit of tweaking (specifically, <a href="read_data.html">data loading</a> should use Node’s built in methods to get the raw data loaded).</p>
<h2 id="why-d3-">Why D3?</h2>
<p><a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> is largely known for its data visualization capabilities - and for good reason. It is quickly becoming the de facto standard for interactive visualization on the web.</p>
<p>Its core feature of binding data to visual representations happens to require a lot of manipulation of said data. So, while this toolkit is based around visualization, it also seems to me to be well suited for data munging as well!</p>
<p>And, a typical output for data manipulation is at least some sort of visualization of that data, in which case you are all ready to go.</p>
<h2 id="why-lodash-">Why lodash?</h2>
<p>Lodash is fast, popular, and fills in some holes in D3’s processing features. Plus, it’s functional style and chaining capabilities make it work well alongside D3.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-site-for-analysis">Preparing Site for Analysis</h2>
<p>To get started using these tools for your data processing, you are going to want to include them in your html file along with a JavaScript file to perform the analysis. </p>
