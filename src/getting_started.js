// # Getting Started
//
// ## About Tasks
//
// Each task tries to encapsulate a concrete lesson around common data manipulation and analysis processes. 
//
// Focus is on client side data processing, but could easily be used in a server side (Node) application with a bit of tweaking (specifically, [data loading](read_data.html) should use Node's built in methods to get the raw data loaded).
//
// ## Why D3?
//
// [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is largely known for its data visualization capabilities - and for good reason. It is quickly becoming the de facto standard for interactive visualization on the web.
//
// Its core feature of binding data to visual representations happens to require a lot of manipulation of said data. So, while this toolkit is based around visualization, it also seems to me to be well suited for data munging as well!
//
// And, a typical output for data manipulation is at least some sort of visualization of that data, in which case you are all ready to go.
//
// ## Why lodash?
//
// Lodash is fast, popular, and fills in some holes in D3's processing features. Plus, it's functional style and chaining capabilities make it work well alongside D3.
//
// ## Preparing Site for Analysis
//
// To get started using these tools for your data processing, you are going to want to include them in your html file along with a JavaScript file to perform the analysis. 
//
// You can
