# Javascript Data

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

[Live version](http://vallandingham.me/js_data/)

Data manipulation, data munging, and data processing in JavaScript. 

## About

A repo of commonly used tools and tips for dealing with data.

Specifically geared around preparing data for further analysis and visualization.

As such, we will focus on using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [lodash](http://lodash.com/) for many of these task.

## Previous Work

This might have been done better before. Certainly this takes inspiration from a number of similar projects around data manipulation geared towards users of other languages. Here are just some other resources to checkout:

- [Python Code Notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/chrisalbon/code_py/tree/master/) - by Chris Albon
- [R Code Notebooks](https://github.com/chrisalbon/code_r) - also by Chris Albon

The presentation format of this repo borrows heavily from Tom MacWright's [Literate Raytracer](https://github.com/tmcw/literate-raytracer) repo.
