# Javascript Data

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

[Live version](http://vallandingham.me/js_data/)

Data manipulation, data munging, and data processing in JavaScript. 

## About

A repo of commonly used tools and tips for dealing with data.

Specifically geared around preparing data for further analysis and visualization.

As such, we will focus on using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [lodash](http://lodash.com/) for many of these task.

Want to add your own tips and tricks that you use to apply the power of JS to data processing?

Fork this project, modify and send me your pull requests!

_(Or you could probably just yell at me on Twitter - and I can add more interesting tasks)_

## Building

If you want to hack on this - or just download and run locally, here is how you would do that.

Requirements:

* node
* npm
* grunt (to rebuild)
* ruby (sorry - its hacky)

First clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:vlandham/js_data.git
```

Then run npm install to gather development dependencies:

```
cd js_data
npm install
```

Grunt should now work. If you make modifications to the source files, they will be reflected in the output.

## Previous Work

This might have been done better before. Certainly this takes inspiration from a number of similar projects around data manipulation geared towards users of other languages. Here are just some other resources to checkout:

- [Python Code Notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/chrisalbon/code_py/tree/master/) - by Chris Albon
- [R Code Notebooks](https://github.com/chrisalbon/code_r) - also by Chris Albon

The presentation format of this repo borrows heavily from Tom MacWright's [Literate Raytracer](https://github.com/tmcw/literate-raytracer) repo.
